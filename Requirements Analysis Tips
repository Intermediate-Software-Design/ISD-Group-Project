Please refer to "SE-Project.pdf" available under "Files" for the delieverable software artifacts. Here are additional clarification on the deliverables:

1. Each functional requirement corresponds to one fully dressed use case.
2. Each use case diagram can correspond to one or more use cases, depending on the complexity of each use case.
3. Each conceptual class diagram can correspond to one or more use cases, depending on the complexity of each use case.
4. Supplementary specifications are all about non-functional requirements.
5. It is OK that the requirements described in documents are somewhat different from the requirements mentioned in the initial project presentation. I totally understand that you may need to improve or revise some of the requirements based on my feedback on the presentation.
